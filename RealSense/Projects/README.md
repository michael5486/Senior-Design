# RealSense Projects

There are a lot of projects in here. Attaching a brief explanation for the important ones

## RF_PersonTracking
Example Person Tracking class with some slight modifications. I used this to try and piece together how person tracking actually worked.

## skeletonJoints
Project that identifies skeleton joints from a user. This was surprisingly difficult to achieve, because Intel does not provide good documentation and some of it is blatantly false/wrong...but now it works :)
